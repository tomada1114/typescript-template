## Setup

Use Node.js 24 and pnpm 11 through Corepack:

```sh
node --version
corepack enable
corepack pnpm@11.18.0 install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm hooks:install
pnpm check
```

The first command must report Node 24.x. `devEngines.runtime.onFail` is an
intentional hard error for normal development; use the documented override
only for the minimum-Node compatibility check below.

Useful focused commands are `pnpm check:quick`, `pnpm test`,
`pnpm test:coverage`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm docs:build`, and
`pnpm package:smoke`.

## Bootstrap profiles

The template starts as the `node-library` profile. Bootstrap makes one
irreversible choice for the generated repository:

| Profile             | Runtime contract                                   | `sideEffects` |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `node-library`      | Node.js >= 24                                      | `false`       |
| `universal-library` | ES and DOM APIs; Node built-ins fail the src build | `false`       |

The universal profile omits `engines.node`, sets build `types` to an empty
array, and is exercised by the bundler-resolution smoke consumer. The
node-library profile retains Node types.

## Dependency cooldown

The seven-day dependency cooldown in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is fail-closed. If
an urgent security fix is younger than seven days, a maintainer may add the
exact package and version to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in the same reviewed PR
as the lockfile update. Record the advisory and why waiting is riskier, remove
the exception after the version ages out, and never use a broad package-only
or wildcard exclusion.

Development and the published contract both sit on Node 24, so there is no
second runtime to check the package against.

## Pull requests

Create a feature branch, keep commits focused, and use a Conventional Commit
PR title. Update behavior tests, type tests, and documentation when the public
contract changes, and say in the PR what the change does to the version. Run
`pnpm check` before requesting review.

Every pull request explains whether it changes the published package and keeps
the README, tests, and documentation in sync when it does. Documentation, test,
CI, and tooling changes with no release impact need no release record. During
the 0.x period, a breaking change uses a minor bump and must include migration
instructions; after 1.0 it uses a major bump.

## First release

`release.yml` publishes through npm trusted publishing (OIDC, `id-token:
write`, `environment: release`), but npm only lets a trusted publisher be
registered against a package that already exists on the registry. The very
first release has to get the package onto the registry a different way
before trusted publishing can take over:

1. Confirm the name is free: `npm view my-package` errors (404) when nobody
   has published it yet. `package.json`'s own `name` field is the name this
   applies to.
2. Create the `release` GitHub Environment — the name `release.yml`'s
   `environment: release` targets — and add a required reviewer to it.
3. Publish the first version once, outside `release.yml`: run `npm publish`
   locally with 2FA enabled, or generate a granular, scoped npm automation
   token and use it exactly once. This repository has no opinion between the
   two; `release.yml` itself carries no token and only ever drives OIDC
   trusted publishing, so either method is equally fine for this one
   manual step.
4. Register npm trusted publishing for the now-existing package, pointing it
   at this repository's `release.yml` workflow.
5. Revoke or delete the one-time publish token — it should never be needed
   again once trusted publishing is registered.
6. Tag the release: an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag matching `package.json`, the
   same convention "Cutting a prerelease" below uses. Pushing the tag still
   runs `release.yml`; since the version is already on the registry, the
   workflow takes its already-published path and only attaches the GitHub
   Release, without publishing again.

## Release recovery

Releases are driven by a reviewed release PR and an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag
matching `package.json`. If a workflow fails before npm publish,
fix the cause and rerun it. If npm already contains the version, never publish
that version again: verify it with `npm view my-package@X.Y.Z version`, then
repair only the GitHub Release by rerunning the release attachment job or
uploading the original workflow artifact.

A bad release that already reached npm is fixed forward, never by
republishing the same version:

- **Broken but harmless** (a bug, not a security issue): deprecate the bad
  version so it still resolves but warns —
  `npm deprecate my-package@X.Y.Z "<reason>"` — then ship a patch release
  with the fix.
- **Harmful or leaking** (a real vulnerability, a leaked secret, or actively
  broken behavior): move `latest` back to the last good version first —
  `npm dist-tag add my-package@X.Y.Z latest` — deprecate the bad version,
  publish a GitHub Security Advisory, then ship the fix.
- **Unpublish** only inside npm's 72-hour window, and only for a version
  that should never have existed. It is never a routine rollback; a
  corrected new version is.

Supported versions: the latest minor release of the current major version is
supported. During the `0.x` period, only the latest `0.x` release is
supported.

### Cutting a prerelease

To ship a release candidate without moving the `latest` npm dist-tag, set
`package.json`'s version to a semver prerelease (`1.0.0-rc.1`,
`1.0.0-next.3`) and push a matching annotated tag (`v1.0.0-rc.1`,
`v1.0.0-next.3`). `release.yml` parses the prerelease identifier (`rc`,
`next`, …) out of the version and:

- publishes to the npm dist-tag named after that identifier instead of
  `latest`, so `npm install my-package@rc` gets the release candidate while
  a plain `npm install my-package` does not;
- creates the GitHub Release marked as a pre-release.

A version with no prerelease identifier publishes to `latest` and creates an
ordinary GitHub Release, exactly as before.

/**
 * Public entry point.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module is the entire published contract. Anything not re-exported here
 * — in particular everything under `src/internal/` — is private and may change
 * in a patch release, and `package.json#exports` blocks consumers from reaching
 * it by deep import.
 *
 * Every symbol is exported by name on purpose: no `export *`, no default
 * export. Adding a line here is an API change and needs an API report update
 * (`pnpm api:update`) plus a changeset.

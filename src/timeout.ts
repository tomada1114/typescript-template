 * Run an abortable operation under a deadline.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The operation receives an `AbortSignal` and is expected to cooperate: this
 * function cannot stop work that ignores its signal, it only stops *waiting*
 * for it. When the deadline passes, the signal is aborted with the same
 * {@link TimeoutError} the returned promise rejects with.
 *
 * The deadline timer is always cleared and the listener on `options.signal` is
 * always removed, on every exit path, so a long-lived caller signal does not
 * accumulate listeners.
 *
 * Uses only `AbortController` and `setTimeout`, so it behaves identically on
 * Node and in a browser.
 *
 * @param operation - Receives the signal to honor; must return a promise.
 * @param options - See {@link WithTimeoutOptions}.
 * @returns Whatever `operation` resolves with.
 * @throws TimeoutError when the deadline passes first.
 * @throws InvalidInputError when `options.timeoutMs` is out of range.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const response = await withTimeout((signal) => fetch(url, { signal }), {
 *   timeoutMs: 5_000,
 * });
 * ```

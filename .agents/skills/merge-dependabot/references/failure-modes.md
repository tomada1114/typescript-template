# CI Failure Modes on Dependabot PRs

Read this when the survey reports `checks=FAILING`. Diagnose before deciding —
most failures here are mechanical, not regressions.

Pull the real error first:

```bash
gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId' \
  | xargs -I{} gh run view {} --log-failed
```

Which _step_ failed is the fastest way to tell these apart. F1 and F2 fail
before any project code runs; F3 onward fail inside a check.

## F1 — Peer range conflict (`strictPeerDependencies`)

**Symptom:** every job fails at `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` with an
unmet-peer error. The PR bumps one package, and the name in the error is a
different one.

**Cause:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `strictPeerDependencies: true`, so an
unmet or conflicting peer range is a hard failure rather than a warning. The
standing example is `typescript`: `typescript-eslint` and `typedoc` cap their
peer support at 6.0.x, which is why the manifest pins `~6.0.3`. A PR proposing
TypeScript 7 fails here and is **correct to fail**.

**Fix:** hold the PR. Raising this ceiling is a coordinated multi-package
upgrade — all of `typescript`, `typescript-eslint` and `typedoc` at once — not
a routine bump. Never add an override or relax the setting to land it. Say so in
the report and let a human schedule the upgrade.

## F2 — Lockfile out of step with the manifest

**Symptom:** every job fails at `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, complaining
that the lockfile is not up to date with `package.json`.

**Cause:** the manifest constraint changed without a matching lockfile update —
usually after a rebase or a manual conflict resolution.

**This is not a regression.** The bump itself is untested, not broken.

**Fix:** the PR cannot be merged as-is. Take it through the combined-PR path
(SKILL.md Step 4b) and run `pnpm install --lockfile-only` there. Only after the
lockfile is regenerated does CI actually test the new version, so treat the
combined PR's CI run as the first real signal for these bumps.

## F3 — Cooldown rejection (`minimumReleaseAge`)

**Symptom:** install fails because a requested version cannot be resolved, and
the version named in the error was published within the last week.

**Cause:** `minimumReleaseAge: 10080` refuses any version published less than
seven days ago. `.github/dependabot.yml` mirrors this with `cooldown:
default-days: 7`, so this normally cannot happen — except for **security
updates**, which Dependabot deliberately exempts from its own cooldown.

**Fix:** this is the one case where the tension is real: a security fix you want
now against a cooldown that exists to catch a compromised release. Report the
advisory, the affected version, and its publish date. A human must decide
whether to wait out the remaining days or add that exact `package@version` to
`minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in the reviewed dependency PR. Never add a wildcard
or package-only exclusion, and record when the exception will be removed after
the version ages out.

## F4 — Genuine tooling regression

**Symptom:** install succeeds; a later step fails — `pnpm run lint`,
`pnpm run typecheck`, or `pnpm run format:check`.

**Cause:** the new tool version added a rule, changed a default, or tightened
inference. Common with ESLint, typescript-eslint, TypeScript and Prettier bumps.

**Fix:** mechanical fixes (apply the new lint, add a missing annotation, run
`pnpm fix` for a Prettier formatting change) belong on the branch. If the new
version demands a real design decision or a config change with tradeoffs, hold
the PR and report what it wants. Never silence it with `@ts-expect-error` or an
`eslint-disable` to land the bump.

## F5 — Test or coverage failure

**Symptom:** lint and types pass; `pnpm run test:coverage` fails, or coverage
drops below the 80% threshold.

**Fix:** this is a real signal. Read the failure. Hold the PR and report it — do
not chase coverage by editing tests to accommodate a dependency you have not
decided to accept, and do not lower the threshold.

## F6 — Packaging gate only

**Symptom:** lint, types and tests pass; `Package artifact` or
`Package smoke` fails — `publint`, are-the-types-wrong, the tarball allowlist,
or the consumer `tsc` run.

**Cause:** usually a TypeScript bump changing emitted declarations, or a
packaging-metadata interaction. This is exactly the class of break that a
source-only test suite would miss.

**Fix:** reproduce locally, which is far faster than iterating in CI:

```bash
pnpm run package:lint
pnpm run package:smoke
```

If the emitted declarations changed shape, fix the source — but only after you
have confirmed the change is intended.

## F7 — Merge state `BEHIND` or `DIRTY`

Not a CI failure. `BEHIND` means main moved; `DIRTY` means a real conflict.

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --body "@dependabot rebase"
```

Dependabot rebases within a minute or two, then checks re-run. If it conflicts
repeatedly — which is common once two npm PRs are open, since both touch
`pnpm-lock.yaml` — fold the PR into the combined branch and resolve there.

## F8 — Check never reports

**Symptom:** `checks=PENDING` that never resolves, or `checks=NONE`.

**Cause:** workflow concurrency cancellation, or a workflow whose triggers do
not fire for the bot's PRs.

**Fix:** re-run with `gh run rerun <run-id>`. Never merge a PR whose checks never
actually ran — a missing check is not a passing check.

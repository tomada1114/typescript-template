#!/usr/bin/env node
// Pre-commit gate: refuse a commit that would put a secret into history, from
// the git index alone — no tool call, no running agent.
//
// The scope is deliberately narrow. This hook only blocks what is wrong no
// matter who decided it: a secret-shaped path (`.env`, `secrets/**`) or a
// credential in the content of a staged file. Everything else a commit might
// do — deleting a workflow, relaxing a config, lowering a threshold — is a
// judgement call, and a judgement call belongs in the pull request, where a
// reader can weigh it and disagree. A hook cannot.
//
// That narrowness is the point rather than a gap. A hook that blocks
// legitimate work teaches its author to reach for `--no-verify`, and that flag
// turns off the secret check along with everything else. This one should never
// have a reason to fire on work someone meant to do.
//
// It complements `.claude/settings.json`'s `permissions.deny`, which only ever
// sees a tool call inside a Claude Code session; this script sees what
// actually reaches `git commit`, from any author — a human, Codex, or any
// other tool. Two rules stay on that side and are deliberately not duplicated
// here:
//
//   - Lockfile hand-editing. A regenerated lockfile (`pnpm install`) is an
//     ordinary, expected commit, and a git diff cannot tell that apart from a
//     hand edit — only a layer that sees the tool call that produced the
//     change can.
//   - `git commit --no-verify`, a bare force-push, and publish/workflow
//     dispatch leave nothing in a diff for this script to see. `--no-verify`
//     in particular disables this script along with the rest of the git hook
//     chain, so no git hook can catch it — a layer that runs before the commit
//     is even attempted is the only one that can.
//
// Exit codes:
//   0  every staged change is safe to commit
//   1  a staged change was blocked
